## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is the third task under the CODTECH Python Internship Program. The goal of Task 3 is to build a **chatbot using Python and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. Chatbots are conversational agents that simulate human interaction and are widely used across industries such as customer support, healthcare, education, and personal productivity.

In this task, the chatbot was built using simple rule-based logic and NLP techniques such as tokenization, lowercasing, and basic keyword matching. The chatbot is capable of handling a small set of predefined questions or commands and responds accordingly. While it doesn’t use advanced AI models, it serves as an ideal starting point for learning how human language can be processed and interpreted by machines.

The main logic involves analyzing user input, processing the text, and matching it against known patterns to generate appropriate responses. Libraries like **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** were used to tokenize text, remove stop words, and make simple word-based decisions.

This project gives a foundational understanding of how bots work and how input/output-based logic can be enhanced with NLP to make applications smarter. It also highlights how user experience depends on the relevance and natural flow of responses in conversational systems.

## APPLICABILITY / USE CASES

-  Customer service bots for websites  
-  FAQ answering bots for colleges, schools  
-  Appointment scheduling bots for clinics  
-  Personal wellness or journaling assistants  
-  Educational tools and quiz chatbots  
-  Product recommendation assistants in e-commerce  


## FILES INCLUDED
- `chatbot.py` – Python script version of the chatbot  
- `README.md` – This documentation file  
  
## LEARNING OUTCOME

This task helped me understand how Natural Language Processing plays a role in building interactive applications. I learned how user input can be tokenized and interpreted by machines and how rule-based systems can simulate conversation. Even without deep learning, simple bots can be built using conditional statements, keyword lists, and text preprocessing techniques.
The project was a great introduction to NLP and conversational AI. It gave me hands-on practice with how real-world chatbots work at a basic level. I now feel confident in building simple bots, and I am eager to explore more advanced techniques like using intent classifiers, named entity recognition (NER), and transformer models for future chatbot upgrades.
